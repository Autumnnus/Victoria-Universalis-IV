[h1]Important Warning[/h1]
This mod changes some of the vanilla interfaces. So it may not work with some interface mods. If you want the mod to work properly, either disable the interface mods or put the mod at the bottom of the mod list so that the mod has priority. 

For Modders:[url=https://i.imgur.com/42EY2Ne.png] This mod replaces these vanilla interfaces and requires compatibility patches with mods that have the same files. [/url]

Secondly: If you want to cheat for point system use event dev.1 on console but do not change citizenship and religion laws by cheat. Because It doesn't effect for missionaries
